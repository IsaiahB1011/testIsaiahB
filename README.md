Great guy, loving husband and father, that loves learning new things. My journey has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. As of right now I am studying for the CompTIA Security+ Exam. I am also taking the google cybersecurity course on coursera.
